# DbFun 
![Latest build](https://github.com/jacentino/DbFun/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)

This project is successor of [SqlFun](https://github.com/jacentino/SqlFun).

The differences are explained in the project [wiki](https://github.com/jacentino/DbFun/wiki/Differences-between-DbFun-and-SqlFun).

## What's this tool?
DbFun is a tool for writing data access code in F# functional way. 

It's fast, type safe and gives you full control on your queries.

No custom query DSL enabled - just raw SQL.

It's available as a [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DbFun.Core/)
There are also extensions for [MS SQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DbFun.MsSql), [PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DbFun.NpgSql), [Oracle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DbFun.OracleManaged), [Firebird](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DbFun.Firebird) and [MySql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DbFun.MySqlConnector) (when using MySqlConnector) databases.

## Features
* All SQL features available
* Type safety
* High performance
* support for record/tuple/discriminated union parameters
* support for record/tuple/discriminated union results
* Support for parameter and column conversions
* Support for result transformations
* Support for enum types
* Asynchrony
* Template-based queries
* Computation expression for database operations

## Supported databases
In its core DbFun does not use any features specific to some db provider, so it works with any ADO.NET provider. 
The only limitation is possibility of execution of commands in `SchemaOnly` mode.

It was tested against MS SqlServer, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Firebird and SQLite.

There are extensions, enabling provider-specific features:
* the extension for MS SQL, that allows to use table valued parameters
* the extension for PostgreSQL, making use of array parameters possible and adding more comfortable bulk import mechanism
* the extension for Oracle, allowing use of array parameters and adding better support for bulk copy
* the extension for Firebird, improving batch command usage
* the extension for MySQL (when using MySqlConnector) improving use of bulk copy 
* the extension for SQLite, that allows to use date and time values

## How it works
Most of us think about data access code as a separate layer. We don't like to spread SQL queries across all the application.
Better way is to build an API exposing your database, consisting of structures representing database data, and functions responsible for processing this data. 

DbFun promotes good architectures by making it a design requirement. Instead of providing API to execute queries it provides API to generate functions executing queries (in some sens it provides API allowing to create another API).

### Configuration
First step is to define function creating database connection and config record:
```fsharp
let createConnection () = new SqlConnection(<your database connection string>)
let defaultConfig = QueryConfig.Default(createConnection)
```
and wire it up creating object responsible for generating queries:
```fsharp 
let query = QueryBuilder(defaultConfig)
```
and defining function for executing them:
```fsharp 
let run f = DbCall.Run(createConnection, f)
```    
### Data structures
Then, data structures should be defined for results of your queries.
```fsharp 
type Post = {
    id: int
    blogId: int
    name: string
    title: string
    content: string
    author: string
    createdAt: DateTime
    modifiedAt: DateTime option
    modifiedBy: string option
    status: PostStatus
}
    
type Blog = {
    id: int
    name: string
    title: string
    description: string
    owner: string
    createdAt: DateTime
    modifiedAt: DateTime option
    modifiedBy: string option
    posts: Post list
}
```    
The most preferrable way is to use F# record types. Record fields should reflect query result columns, because they are mapped by name.
    
### Defining queries
The usual way of defining query functions is to create variables for them and place in some module:
```fsharp 
module Blogging =    
 
    let getBlog = query.Sql<int, Blog>(
        "select id, name, title, description, owner, createdAt, modifiedAt, modifiedBy
         from Blog
         where id = @id",
        "id")
            
    let getPosts = query.Sql<int, Post list>(
        "select id, blogId, name, title, content, author, createdAt, modifiedAt, modifiedBy, status 
         from post 
         where blogId = @blogId",
        "blogId") 
```        
The functions executing queries are generated during a first access to the module contents. 

At that stage, all the type checking is performed, so it's easy to make type checking part of automatic testing - one line of code for each module is needed.

The generating process uses little bit of reflection, but no reflection is used while processing a query, since generated code is executed.

### Executing queries
Queries defined above return `DbCall<'t>`, that is function taking IConnector (object carrying database connection and optionally transaction) and returning data wrapped in Async. They can be passed to the `run` function after applying preceding parameters.
```fsharp
async {
    let! blog = Blogging.getBlog 1 |> run
}
```
The run function manages a database connection, that is opened and closed inside it. To execute more queries on one open connection the `dbsession` computation expression can be used:
```fsharp
dbsession {
    let! postId = Blogging.insertPost post
    do! Blogging.insertComments postId comments
    do! Blogging.insertTags postId tags
}
|> run
// It's Async, so you should call Async.RunSynchronously to obtain raw result
```
### Compound parameters
Records can be parameters as well::
```fsharp
let insertPost = query.Sql<Post, int>(
    "insert into post 
            (blogId, name, title, content, author, createdAt, status)
     values (@blogId, @name, @title, @content, @author, @createdAt, @status);
     select scope_identity()")
```
### Explicit parameter and result definition
There is an alternative way of defining parameters and results by using specifiers. It's more verbose, that method presented above:
```fsharp
let insertPost = query.Sql(
    "insert into post 
            (blogId, name, title, content, author, createdAt, status)
     values (@blogId, @name, @title, @content, @author, @createdAt, @status);
     select scope_identity()",
    Params.Record<Post>(),
    Results.Int "")
```
but gives the user lot of flexibility, e.g. provide parameter names represented by tuple items:
```fsharp
let insertTag = query.Sql(
    "insert into tag (postId, name) values (@postId, @name)",
    Params.Tuple<int, string>("postId", "name"),
    Results.Unit)
```
### Stored procedures
Functions invoking stored procedures return tuple results, containing regular result and, optionally, output parameters.
If no out params are specified, unit type is used.
```fsharp
let getAllPosts = query.Proc<int, unit, Post list>("GetAllPosts", "blogid") >> DbCall.Map fst
```
In case of MS SQL Server, it's possible to specify return parameter, that becomes part of out parameters structure:
```fsharp
let getAllPosts = query.Proc("GetAllPosts",
    Params.Int "blogid",
    OutParams.Return("ret_val"),
    Results.List<Post>())
```
### Result transformations
ADO.NET commands allow to specify queries returning multiple results. DbFun leverages it by providing special types of result specifiers, that combine subsequent results,
either for single master records with details:
```fsharp
let getOnePostWithTagsAndComments = query.Sql<int, Post>(
    "select id, blogId, name, title, content, author, createdAt, modifiedAt, modifiedBy, status
     from post
     where id = @postId;
     select c.id, c.postId, c.parentId, c.content, c.author, c.createdAt
     from comment c
     where c.postId = @postId
     select t.postId, t.name
     from tag t
     where t.postId = @postId",
    "postId",
    Results.Combine(fun post comments tags -> { post with comments = comments; tags = tags })
    <*> Results.Single<Post>()
    <*> Results.List<Comment>()
    <*> Results.List<string> "name")
```
or for collections of master and details records, matched by key:
```fsharp
let p = any<Post>
let getManyPostsWithTagsAndComments = query.Sql<int, Post seq>(
    "select id, blogId, name, title, content, author, createdAt, modifiedAt, modifiedBy, status
     from post
     where blogId = @blogId;
     select c.id, c.postId, c.parentId, c.content, c.author, c.createdAt
     from comment c join post p on c.postId = p.id
     where p.blogId = @blogId
     select t.postId, t.name
     from tag t join post p on t.postId = p.id
     where p.blogId = @blogId",
    "blogId", 
    Results.PKeyed<int, Post> "id"
    |> Results.Join p.comments (Results.FKeyed "postId")
    |> Results.Join p.tags (Results.FKeyed("postId", "name"))
    |> Results.Unkeyed)
```
